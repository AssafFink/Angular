# DevGeekWeek - Angular Getting Started

Congrats for completing Angular Getting Started :-)

I've attached several things to this GIT: 

1. Our example done in class during the convention.

2. Custom Pipe (inside the example)

3. Custom Attribute Directive (inside the example)

4. Custom Structural Directive (inside the example)

5. I've checked the idea discus in class regarding interface as a service with two services implementing it, but an interface can't be set as a service in Angular as a Provider of any kind.

6. I've checked how to create multiple environment files and created it (inside the example)
   The syntax is layed-out here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50174584/how-to-set-environment-via-ng-serve-in-angular-6
   
7. My powerpoint presentation


Good luck to you all and maybe we'll meet again :-)

Assaf.
